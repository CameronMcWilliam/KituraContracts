# KituraContracts

[![Build Status - Master](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-Swift/KituraContracts.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-Swift/KituraContracts)

## Summary

KituraContracts is a library containing type definitions shared by client (eg [KituraKit](https://ibm-swift.github.io/KituraKit/)) and server (eg [Kitura](https://ibm-swift.github.io/Kitura)) code. These shared type definitions include [Codable Closure Aliases](https://ibm-swift.github.io/KituraContracts/Typealiases.html), [RequestError](https://ibm-swift.github.io/KituraContracts/Structs/RequestError.html), [Identifier Protocol](https://ibm-swift.github.io/KituraContracts/Protocols/Identifier.html#/s:15KituraContracts10IdentifierP5valueSSv) and [Extensions to String and Int](https://ibm-swift.github.io/KituraContracts/Extensions.html#/s:SS) which add conformity to the Identifier protocol.
